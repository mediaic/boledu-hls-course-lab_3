Board: AlveoU50, Vitis version: 2022.1

※ Please refer to the .pdf tutorial.

※ Note that, for the arguments of the host.cpp program, please change to the following 2 arguments.

`Xilinx    xilinx_u50_gen3x16_xdma_base_5`

(p.s.1 In a newer version of vitis, there is an option "Automatically add binary container(s) to arguments", select this option and the third argument is filled automatically)

(p.s.2 The second argument is server machine dependent, check your platform name in the terminal with  "xbutil examine" command )
